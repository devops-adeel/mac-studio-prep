## 📦 Version Managers Status

### Currently Installed
- **nvm** - Node Version Manager (keep as-is, not via Homebrew)

### Not Installed (Consider if needed)
- pyenv (Python version management)
- rbenv (Ruby version management)
- rustup (Rust version management)

---

## 🚀 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Backup Current State
```bash
# Create backup of current Homebrew state
brew bundle dump --force --file=~/Brewfile.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Phase 2: Adopt Existing Applications
For apps already installed manually, use the --adopt flag:
```bash
brew install --cask --adopt alfred
brew install --cask --adopt google-chrome
# etc...
```

### Phase 3: Install Missing Tools
```bash
# Install all recommended CLI tools
brew install wget htop tmux ffmpeg imagemagick watch fzf ncdu tldr autojump dust procs hyperfine tokei
```

### Phase 4: Generate Complete Brewfile
See the generated Brewfile in this directory for a complete, version-controlled setup.

## 📝 Notes

1. **App Store Apps**: Todoist, Keynote, Numbers, and Pages are from the App Store. Todoist can be migrated to Homebrew, but iWork apps cannot.

2. **Enterprise Apps**: IBM and security tools (Falcon, Code42) cannot be managed via Homebrew.

3. **Version Managers**: Keep nvm as-is (not managed by Homebrew) for flexibility.

4. **Docker**: You have both Docker.app and OrbStack. Consider using only OrbStack for lighter resource usage.

5. **Fonts**: You have several Nerd Fonts installed via Homebrew - these are good for terminal use.
